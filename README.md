# Github-Finder

Github Finder is designed to use Github's v3 API to search and sort repositories across Github. It uses `Chakra-UI` as it's UI library and `React Context` for state management. Other dependencies include `base-64, axios, react-markdown, react-router-dom and react-icons`.

### It is recommended to create and use `.env.local` file and setup `REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` variables.
